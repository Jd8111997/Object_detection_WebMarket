# Object-detection-webmarket
Object detection on Webmarket dataset using Detectron2.   

# Introduction   
The project is about object recognition on a WebMarket dataset, which contains around 3,153
images of what you see when standing about 1 meter away from a shelf in a supermarket store.
I have fine tuned Facebook's Detectron2 model for object detection task.
